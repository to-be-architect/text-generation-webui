# WizardCoder: Empowering Code Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct


To develop our WizardCoder model, we begin by adapting the Evol-Instruct method specifically for coding tasks. This involves tailoring the prompt to the domain of code-related instructions. Subsequently, we fine-tune the Code LLM, StarCoder, utilizing the newly created instruction-following training set.

## News

- üî• Our **WizardCoder-15B-v1.0** model achieves the **57.3 pass@1** on the [HumanEval Benchmarks](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), which is **22.3** points higher than the SOTA open-source Code LLMs.
- üî• We released **WizardCoder-15B-v1.0** trained with **78k** evolved code instructions. Please checkout the [Model Weights](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-15B-V1.0), and [Paper]().
- &#x1F4E3; Please refer to our Twitter account https://twitter.com/WizardLM_AI and HuggingFace Repo https://huggingface.co/WizardLM . We will use them to announce any new release at the 1st time. 


## Comparing WizardCoder with the Closed-Source Models.


üî• The following figure shows that our **WizardCoder attains the third position in this benchmark**, surpassing Claude-Plus (59.8 vs. 53.0) and Bard (59.8 vs. 44.5). Notably, our model exhibits a substantially smaller size compared to these models.

</p>

‚ùó**Note: In this study, we copy the scores for HumanEval and HumanEval+ from the [LLM-Humaneval-Benchmarks](https://github.com/my-other-github-account/llm-humaneval-benchmarks). Notably, all the mentioned models generate code solutions for each problem utilizing a **single attempt**, and the resulting pass rate percentage is reported. Our **WizardCoder** generates answers using greedy decoding and tests with the same [code](https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus).**

## Comparing WizardCoder with the Open-Source Models.

The following table clearly demonstrates that our **WizardCoder** exhibits a substantial performance advantage over all the open-source models. ‚ùó**If you are confused with the different scores of our model (57.3 and 59.8), please check the Notes.**


| Model            | HumanEval Pass@1 | MBPP Pass@1 |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| CodeGen-16B-Multi| 18.3             |20.9         |
| CodeGeeX         | 22.9             |24.4         |
| LLaMA-33B        | 21.7             |30.2         |
| LLaMA-65B        | 23.7             |37.7         |
| PaLM-540B        | 26.2             |36.8         |
| PaLM-Coder-540B  | 36.0             |47.0         |
| PaLM 2-S         | 37.6             |50.0         |
| CodeGen-16B-Mono | 29.3             |35.3         |
| Code-Cushman-001 | 33.5             |45.9         |
| StarCoder-15B    | 33.6             |43.6*        |
| InstructCodeT5+  | 35.0             |--           |
| WizardLM-30B  1.0| 37.8             |--           |
| WizardCoder-15B  1.0 | **57.3**     |**51.8**     |


‚ùó**Note: The reproduced result of StarCoder on MBPP.**

‚ùó**Note: The above table conducts a comprehensive comparison of our **WizardCoder** with other models on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. We adhere to the approach outlined in previous studies by generating **20 samples** for each problem to estimate the pass@1 score and evaluate with the same [code](https://github.com/openai/human-eval/tree/master). The scores of GPT4 and GPT3.5 reported by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) are 67.0 and 48.1 (maybe these are the early version GPT4&3.5).**

## Call for Feedbacks
We welcome everyone to use your professional and difficult instructions to evaluate WizardCoder, and show us examples of poor performance and your suggestions in the [issue discussion](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/issues) area. We are focusing on improving the Evol-Instruct now and hope to relieve existing weaknesses and issues in the the next version of WizardCoder. After that, we will open the code and pipeline of up-to-date Evol-Instruct algorithm and work with you together to improve it.

## Online Demo

We will provide our latest models for you to try for as long as possible. If you find a link is not working, please try another one. At the same time, please try as many **real-world** and **challenging** code-related problems that you encounter in your work and life as possible. We will continue to evolve our models with your feedbacks.



## Fine-tuning

We fine-tune WizardCoder using the modified code `train.py` from [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X).
We fine-tune StarCoder-15B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | StarCoder-15B |
|----------------|---------------|
| Batch size     | 512           |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5          |
| Epochs         | 3             |
| Max length     | 2048          |
| Warmup step    | 30            |
| LR scheduler   | cosine        |

To reproduce our fine-tuning of WizardCoder, please follow the following steps:
1. According to the instructions of [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X), install the environment, download the training code, and deploy. (Note: `deepspeed==0.9.2` and `transformers==4.29.2`)
2. Replace the `train.py` with the `train_wizardcoder.py` in our repo (`src/train_wizardcoder.py`)
3. Login Huggingface:
```bash
huggingface-cli login
```
4. Execute the following training command:
```bash
deepspeed train_wizardcoder.py \
    --model_name_or_path "bigcode/starcoder" \
    --data_path "/your/path/to/code_instruction_data.json" \
    --output_dir "/your/path/to/ckpt" \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --model_max_length 2048 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 16 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 50 \
    --save_total_limit 2 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --warmup_steps 30 \
    --logging_steps 2 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --report_to "tensorboard" \
    --gradient_checkpointing True \
    --deepspeed configs/deepspeed_config.json \
    --fp16 True
```

## Inference

We provide the decoding script for WizardCoder, which reads a input file and generates corresponding responses for each sample, and finally consolidates them into an output file.

You can specify `base_model`, `input_data_path` and `output_data_path` in `src\inference_wizardcoder.py` to set the decoding model, path of input file and path of output file.

```bash
pip install jsonlines
```

The decoding command is:
```
python src\inference_wizardcoder.py \
    --base_model "/your/path/to/ckpt" \
    --input_data_path "/your/path/to/input/data.jsonl" \
    --output_data_path "/your/path/to/output/result.jsonl"
```

The format of `data.jsonl` should be:
```
{"idx": 11, "Instruction": "Write a Python code to count 1 to 10."}
{"idx": 12, "Instruction": "Write a Jave code to sum 1 to 10."}
```

The prompt for our WizardCoder in `src\inference_wizardcoder.py` is:
```
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{instruction}

### Response:
```

## Evaluation

We provide the evaluation script on HumanEval for WizardCoder.

1. According to the instructions of [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), install the environment.
2. Run the following script to generate the answer.
```bash
model="/path/to/your/model"
temp=0.2
max_len=2048
pred_num=200
num_seqs_per_iter=2

output_path=preds/T${temp}_N${pred_num}

mkdir -p ${output_path}
echo 'Output path: '$output_path
echo 'Model to eval: '$model

# 164 problems, 21 per GPU if GPU=8
index=0
gpu_num=8
for ((i = 0; i < $gpu_num; i++)); do
  start_index=$((i * 21))
  end_index=$(((i + 1) * 21))

  gpu=$((i))
  echo 'Running process #' ${i} 'from' $start_index 'to' $end_index 'on GPU' ${gpu}
  ((index++))
  (
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$gpu python humaneval_gen.py --model ${model} \
      --start_index ${start_index} --end_index ${end_index} --temperature ${temp} \
      --num_seqs_per_iter ${num_seqs_per_iter} --N ${pred_num} --max_len ${max_len} --output_path ${output_path}
  ) &
  if (($index % $gpu_num == 0)); then wait; fi
done
```
3. Run the post processing code `src/process_humaneval.py` to collect the code completions from all answer files.
```bash
output_path=preds/T${temp}_N${pred_num}

echo 'Output path: '$output_path
python process_humaneval.py --path ${output_path} --out_path ${output_path}.jsonl --add_prompt

evaluate_functional_correctness ${output_path}.jsonl
```
